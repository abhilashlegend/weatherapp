## Dockerizing Angular App

Steps to dockerizing the angular App
1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Create Dockerfile in the project root folder.

```
1 # Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
2 FROM node:latest as build
3
4 # Set the working directory in the container
5 WORKDIR /usr/local/app
6
7 # Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
8 COPY ./ /usr/local/app/
9
10 # Install application dependencies
11 RUN npm install
12
13 # Generate the build of the application
14 RUN npm run build
15
16 # Stage 2: Serve app with nginx server
17
18 # Use official nginx image as the base image
19 FROM nginx:latest
20
21 # Copy the build output to replace the default nginx contents.
22 COPY --from=build /usr/local/app/dist/weatherapp
/usr/share/nginx/html
23
24 # Expose port 80
25 EXPOSE 80
26
```

3.	Run ng build command to build the angular application
4.	Use the following command to generate the Docker image for the Angular application using Dockerfile:
Example: docker build -t dockerhub_name/image_name:tag dockerfile_location

```
docker build -t abhilash456a/weatherapp:latest .
```
5.	Get the list of Docker images using the following command:

```
Docker image ls
```

6.	You need to push the Docker image to Docker Hub or any container registry(AWS ECR, Azure CR) if you want to deploy the application on the Cloud server.
To push the Docker image to the Docker hub you need a Docker hub account. Once you created a Docker hub account, then log in to the Docker hub on your terminal.

```
docker login
```

7.	Use the following command to push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

```
docker push abhilash456a/weatherapp:latest
```

8. Run Docker Container
Run the Angular application using the following command

```
    docker run -d -p 80:80 abhilash456a/weatherapp:latest
```

   It runs on port number 80. Access the Angular application using the IP                                      address and port number.
    http://localhost:80/ 

9. list the containers by below command->

```
docker ps
```





## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
